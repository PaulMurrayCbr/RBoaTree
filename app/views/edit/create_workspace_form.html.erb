<h1>Create Workspace</h1>

<p>
	This action will create a new workspace.
</p>
<p>
	A workspace is a tree which is not <u>finalised</u>. It does not have a persistent uri, it can be discarded. Normally, once you have created a workspace
	you will 'adopt' nodes from other trees and then proceed to work on them.
</p>
<p>
	You can 'apply' any node in a workspace that was originally adopted from some tree. When you do this, the node and any modified nodes below it are finalised (issued with a persistent id)
	and moved from the workspace into the target tree, replacing current nodes from that target tree. 
</p>
<p>
	Nodes which are not 'finalised' never undergo versioning. Changes that you make to a workspace are not undoable. However, there's nothing
	to stop you finalising nodes in your workspace without applying them. Once you are happy with your workspace, you can apply the nodes as they appear then.
