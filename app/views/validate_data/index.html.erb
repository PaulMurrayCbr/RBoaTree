<h1>Validate data structure</h1>

<div>
	<p>
		This page runs a set of validation checks on the tree database. The atomic operations that manipulate the tree should always leave it in a valid
		state. However, the tree database may fail these checks if:
		<ol>
			<li>
				You use some tool to directly update the tables.
			</li>
			<li>
				There are transaction isolation problems.
			</li>
		</ol>
	</p>
	<p>
		If the data in the database should become invalid, then you can "fix" it by erasing everything. We do not have a 'repair' process at this point.
	</p>
	<p>
		Validation is a "big" operation, and would possibly be infeasible to do against a real data set. It's here for test and demonstration purposes
		only.
